# Crab Game

Project for the AIGT course at Utrecht University about Player Models.

Play as a crab trapped inside a sandbox and avoid getting eaten (touching) moving seagulls for 30 seconds by moving away from them.
The environment is 2D, and player movement is horizontal, vertical or diagonal, using either the arrow keys or WASD keys from a keyboard.

Each difficulty level adjusts the seagull speed and spawn rate.
The game automatically chooses the difficulty based on the playerâ€™s recent performance in the current difficulty.
In the last 6 games of the current difficulty, if the player has 5 or 6 wins, difficulty increases, and if 1 or 0 wins, difficulty decreases.
