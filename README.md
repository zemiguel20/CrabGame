# AIGT Project

## Project description

Project for the "AI for Game Technology" course about Reinforcement Learning.

## Game Design

Move a crab inside a sandbox in order to dodge moving seagulls. The player should survive
the most time he can without touching any seagull.
The environment is 2D. Player movement is horizontal, vertical or diagonal, using either the
arrow keys or WASD keys from a keyboard.
Seagulls spawn in a random spot in the border of the sandbox, and move in a single
direction. The spawn point can be one from a set of possible points (currently North, Sound,
East and West), and the direction is the player's position at spawn time.
