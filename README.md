# Crab Game

Project for the AIGT course at Utrecht University.

Play as a crab trapped inside a sandbox and avoid getting eaten (touching)
moving seagulls for 30 seconds by moving away from them.
The environment is 2D and player movement is horizontal, vertical
or diagonal, using either the arrow keys or WASD keys from a keyboard.

The player can choose between 3 difficulty levels before starting each run.
